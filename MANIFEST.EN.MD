## Preface. A Fundamental Proposition

Whatever permits enduring possession,
inheritance, or accumulation
inevitably transforms into a form of domination.

Domination does not arise from ill intent,
but from the mere allowance of accumulation itself.

The question, therefore, is not one of fair distribution,
but of the very existence of accumulable objects.

Communi-Sovietism does not seek to refine power,
does not undertake the education of a “new man”,
and offers no promise of final prosperity.

The sole purpose of cosovism is this:
**to render domination structurally impossible.**

## Chapter I. Communi

### On Collective Production

Communi refers exclusively to **necessary production**.

Communi is not an identity,
not a class,
and not a way of life.
It is a **temporary condition of shared labour**,
formed for the execution of a specific task.

* All necessary production is carried out collectively
* Labour is distributed by task
* Rotation is compulsory
* Upon completion, immediate dissolution follows
* Professions do not arise
* The entrenchment of positions is excluded
* No permanent category of “worker” exists

Labour possesses no moral privilege
and is not recognised as a source of social worth.

**Aim:**
the abolition of professionalisation
and the removal of subordination imposed for the sake of survival.

---

## Chapter II. The Soviet

### On Affairs and Decisions

A Soviet is constituted **by a matter**, not by persons.

* Parties do not exist
* Permanent authority does not exist
* Permanent organs do not exist

Each Soviet arises from a concrete question
and ceases to exist upon its resolution.

* The structure of decision is shorter than that of execution
* Execution is shorter-lived than decision
* Termination takes precedence over continuation

Any Soviet that seeks its own preservation
is to be dissolved without delay.

**Aim:**
to prevent the consolidation of power
and the conversion of the temporary into the permanent.

---

## Chapter III. Existence

### A Premise Beyond Communi and the Soviet

Existence is not an object of exchange.

* Existence is not subject to Communi
* Existence is not subject to the Soviet

Food, shelter, and medical care
are provided unconditionally,
without assessment, accounting, or return.

Any system that employs existence as leverage
constitutes a form of coercion.

**Aim:**
the elimination of hunger, homelessness,
and all pressure exerted through survival.

---

## Chapter IV. Resources and Money

Any form of money that may be accumulated
inevitably becomes an instrument of domination.

Accordingly:

* Money is abolished
* Assets are abolished
* Inheritance is abolished

Resources required for existence are distributed unconditionally.
Non-essential resources are permitted only for immediate use,
without storage, transfer, or conversion into power.

**Aim:**
the abolition of wealth
and of all social relations mediated by it.

---

## Chapter V. Voluntariness and Interest

Voluntary activity is not labour.
Interest is not obligation.

* Participation is entirely voluntary
* Withdrawal is unrestricted
* No records are kept
* Ranking is prohibited
* Reward is excluded

Any voluntariness that is measured
inevitably degenerates into exploitation.

**Aim:**
to prevent hierarchies of interest
and the instrumentalisation of desire.

---

## Chapter VI. Family and Relationships

The family performs no institutional function.

* The family does not secure existence
* The family does not govern education
* The family does not allocate resources

Emotional stability is permitted;
institutional advantage is forbidden.

**Aim:**
the dissolution of family economy
and the reproduction of origin-based privilege.

---

## Chapter VII. Education and Capabilities

The privatisation of education
inevitably restores monopoly over capability.

Therefore:

* Education is wholly public
* Diplomas do not exist
* Prescribed paths do not exist
* Entry remains perpetually open

Capabilities are to be disseminated,
not certified nor fixed.

**Aim:**
to prevent the emergence of expert castes
and the capitalisation of skill.

---

## Chapter VIII. Knowledge and Authorship

Knowledge, once recognised as property,
becomes a form of power.

Cosovism recognises neither:

* copyright
* patents
* ownership of knowledge

Creation is acknowledged.
Appropriation is denied.

**Aim:**
the elimination of monopolised knowledge
and cultural capital.

---

## Chapter IX. Privacy, Anonymity, and Transparency

Surveillance is not security.
It is the opening act of domination.

* The operation of the system is transparent
* Rules and procedures are public
* Outcomes are subject to scrutiny

At the same time:

* Thought is inviolable
* Motives are not recorded
* Anonymity is preferable to identification

**Aim:**
to prevent data from becoming currency
and identity from becoming resource.

---

## Chapter X. Refusal, Disruption, and Failure

Inability to cooperate is not a crime.
Refusal to participate is not a threat.

* Existence cannot be withdrawn
* The system must endure non-participation

In conditions of crisis,
degeneration is preferred to concentration,
slowing to intensification.

**Aim:**
to prevent the normalisation of emergency
and the coercive restoration of order.

---

## Conclusion

Communi is responsible for production.
The Soviet is responsible for action.
Existence is subordinate to neither.

Communi-Sovietism does not fashion an ideal human being.
It abolishes the very possibility of domination.

This is not a promise of happiness.
It is the minimal structure of refusal of power.

**Such is cosovism.**
