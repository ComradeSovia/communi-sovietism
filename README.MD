This repository contains multiple language editions of the **Communi-Sovietism Manifesto**.

The files are collected and organised as part of a written assignment.  
Different versions correspond to different languages, writing systems, and orthographic conventions.

The texts are not strict one-to-one translations.  
They represent parallel readings based on the same core material.
